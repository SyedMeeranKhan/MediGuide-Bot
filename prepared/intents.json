A paste made of dry ginger (sonth) with a little water or milk when applied to the forehead also gives relief. A ripe apple, after removing the upper rind and the inner hard portion should be taken with a little salt every morning on an empty stomach. Continue for a week. This yields good results even in case of chronic headaches."
